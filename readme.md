The cayde library is a library that provides aide in data collection and data intelligence.
It makes retrieval of data easier and faster. In addition, it is able to extract certain features from the data.
In addition, it performs real time analysis of the data and attempts to develop a model in the background.

And yes, it was inspired by Bungie's [Cayde-6](https://destiny.fandom.com/wiki/Cayde-6) character.
